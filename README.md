# Icebox
A very simple file encryption program.
Encrypts every single file in the folder called 'Icebox' this folder must be BESIDE the script, the script cannot be INSIDE the same folder
otherwise it will not execute. It will generate a key file called Icekey.key DO NOT LOSE THAT FILE!
If you lose your key file there is no way to recover your data.. period. Use carefully and at your own risk.

# Purpose
Encrypt some important files on the go and quickly using this, it doesnt encrypt files individually but rather loops through an entire directory and encrypts
any and all files in that directory. HOWEVER, this is a very simple build and will not enter any directories inside of the 'Icebox' directories, so do not
add a folder of files in there, just move the files manually. Might add the functionality to check for subdirectories and then loop through them later.
